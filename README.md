# Barber App

This is an app intended to allow barber shops to sign up, and allow an interface for employees and customers to make better business.
Customers will be able to log on and make appointments. Those users can also upload photos of hair cuts.
Employees in turn will be able to log on, and view appointments and the photos associated with those. 

This is app is a pure front end app, so all data will be persisted on clover's and firebase's servers

This app uses the clover api to persist customers, employees, merchants, and handle the transaction.

The photos will be stored in an external database, called firebase.
